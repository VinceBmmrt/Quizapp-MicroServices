# Quiz App â€“ Microservices with Telusko

This project is a quiz application built as part of the Telusko course, demonstrating the evolution from a monolithic architecture to a microservices-based architecture.

## Goal

The main objective is to show step-by-step:

- How a traditional monolithic app works  
- How to break it down into independent microservices, each responsible for a specific domain (e.g., quiz, users, results, etc.)
